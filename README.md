# MinecraftServer1.7.10
__This my first Minecraft Server__
____
This server was created on minecraft version 1.7.10 to play with friends. The server is based on the Thermos core, Forge is also pre-installed on the server. Together with a friend, I made my own build for our comfortable game:

1) Taumcraft - magic
2) the lord of the rings - LOTR
3) NotEnougth Items - view crafts
4) Forestry - beekeeping
5) Botania minecraft - vlad will mine coal
6) Witchery craft - adds rituals and local spells
7) Tinker construct - new tools
8) Legendary Item - addon for LOTR
9) Psychedelicraft - tobacco, alcohol, drugs
10) So Many Enchantments - new enchantments
11) Blood Magic - rituals with blood
12) Coffee And Tea - coffee and tea
13) Hide Names - hides nicknames
14) Sit mod - allows you to sit on steps and floor blocks
15) Antique Atlas - adds a map in the form of a book
16) BiomesOPlenty - new generation

Unfortunately, I could not implement the generation in the world of LOTR (the Lord of the Rings). For two days I tried to put structures on the server, but all my attempts were clear. But at least I got acquainted with the generation in Minecraft, and now I know how it works. If someone knows how to implement the generation of buildings on the server, please contact me via mail:

I also really want to thank one person on YouTube who showed me a new core and libraries for creating a server in Minecraft.

I hope that if someone, like me, wants to return to Minecraft, and remember what it was like to play it with friends, he will use my repository and be able to start a local server to play with friends.
